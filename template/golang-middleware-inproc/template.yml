  This function consumes the watchdog via its Go SDK rather than
  running two separate processes. It is for testing and will
  likely be merged into the normal "golang-middleware" template
  in the future and be deleted itself. Pin to a specific
  SHA if you do want use this template.

  You have created a new function which uses Go 1.25 and Alpine
  Linux as its base image. The go.mod version is set to 1.24.0
  for compatibility.

  To disable the go module, for private vendor code, please use
  "--build-arg GO111MODULE=off" with faas-cli build or configure this
  via your stack.yml file.
